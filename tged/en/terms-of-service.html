      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the rights, obligations, and
        responsibilities between
        <strong>"Detail Games Co., Ltd."</strong> ("Company") and users
        regarding the use of services provided by the Company.
      </p>

      <h2>Article 1 (Purpose)</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of these Terms is to define the fundamental matters
        regarding the use of services, related memberships, and other associated
        services provided by the Company, including the rights, obligations,
        responsibilities, conditions of use, and procedures between members and
        the Company.
      </p>

      <h2>Article 2 (Acceptance of Terms)</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms take effect when the user clicks the "Agree and Next" button
        during the account creation process for using the Company's services
        (the "Effective Date"). By doing so, the user agrees to be bound by the
        provisions of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute a contract between the Company and any individual
        user ("User" or "You") accessing or using the services, including the
        "Privacy Policy."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company reserves the right to update and modify these Terms and the
        Services at any time. Any new features or tools added to the current
        services will also be subject to these Terms. If changes are made, the
        Company will notify users at least 7 days in advance via the app's main
        screen and notice board. However, if the changes are disadvantageous to
        users, the Company will provide at least 30 days of prior notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user does not agree to the revised Terms, they may discontinue
        use and cancel (withdraw) their membership. However, if the user does
        not express refusal and continues to use the service after 7 days from
        the effective date of the revised Terms, it will be deemed that the user
        has accepted the changes.
